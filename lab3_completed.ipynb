    "# 1. Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be called to interact programmatically with Amazon's cloud platform. The choice of the platform is to a certain extent arbitrary (many competitors offer similar services), yet AWS still seems to be a standard goto in many companies. Apple, for example, [spends 30 million per month on AWS](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/apple-spends-more-than-30-million-on-amazon-web-services-a-month.html). Alternatively, there is [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/), which is growing in a quite fast pace. There's also [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) More importantly, the skills that you will acquire in dealing with AWS are also useful when approaching the alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is to prepare you to interact with AWS, like creating and configuring resources. Next week we will be focused on using these resources (that you'll know how to create) to actually do heavy computation for us. There are many things I want to touch base in this lab:\n",
    "- Using AWS console;\n",
    "- Using AWS CLI;\n",
    "- Using AWS sdk for Python;\n",
    "However, we have limited time, and the stress level is already quite high. I get it! So, I'll make some of this stuff optional. If you have time, and are willing to explore, go ahead. I will assist you in all optional questions as well, so you don't miss anything. If you don't have time or decide not to do it for whatever reason, it is totally fine too, and you can explore this in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some extra resources:\n",
    "- [Datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/aws-ec2-beginner-tutorial).\n",
    "- If you have a couple hours, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFdBD3YdLJc&feature=youtu.be) which is a great introductory lecture."

    "rubric={mechanics:20}\n",
    "\n",
    "Log into your AWS Management Console and search for EC2. Record how long the following process will take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the button `Launch Instance` button;\n",
    "2. Next, you need to choose an `Amazon Machine Image` (AMI). Note that there are many `AMI` options for you, of different systems. You are going to create your own later in the lab. For now, pick `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS`.\n",
    "3. The next step is to choose the `Instance Type`. This is where you specify how powerful you want your instance to be. Take a look at the `vCPUS` column and `Memory (GiB)` column. There are some quite powerful options. For example, `x1e.32xlarge` has 128 vCPUS and 3904 GiB of memory. Nice right? What is not very nice is the price of this machine. Take a look [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) - the `x1e.32xlarge` costs USD $26.688 per hour. For this exercise `t2.small` is enough. But if this doesn't make you happy, don't worry, we are going to play with more powerful instances eventually.\n",
    "4. You don't need to change anything in `Configure Instance Details`. Just move ahead to `Add Storage`.\n",
    "5. Nothing here either, go to `Next: Add Tags`.\n",
    "6. In many AWS resources, you are able to add tags with metadata. One usage of metadata is for creating policy. In fact, we have a policy in place. You will only be allowed to create instances if you create a tag with `Key = Owner` and `Value` your username (see the top blue bar on the right). Go ahead, create the tag. Click on `Next: Configure Security Group`.\n",
    "7. You are not allowed to create new security groups. So select the option `Select an existing security group`, then select the security group that will appear. \n",
    "8. Click `Review and Launch`. Then, `Launch`.\n",
    "9. You will be prompted to `Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair`. Remember, this computer will is located in Amazon's facilities. You will access it remotely. This is your way in. If you choose `Proceed without a key pair` there will be a warning saying that you won't be able to connect to the instance. Create a new key pair and download it.\n",
    "10. You did it!!! Now, launch the instance!! Then `View Instances`. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can take a minute for the instance to fire up. You can check the instance state (sometimes you need to refresh the browser to update the state). Now, you might see a bunch of instances in there. it is because you can see the instances your colleagues launched. Not to worry, remember the tag you created? You can filter the instances by tag in the search bar.\n",

If you right-click on the instance, you will see a `connect` option. There are a few options for connecting, here we are going to use `a standalone SSH client`. To SSH into the instance, you are going to need the `.pem` file, which is the file you downloaded when you created new keys. The thing is, AWS is strict about his file. It must be only readable to you (for security). On Linux/Mac OS, you can just `chmod 400 file-name.pem` (on Windows, right-click the file -> Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> Disable Inheritance -> Make the permissions explicit -> Remove everybody and leave only your username with access to the file.)\n",

    "Amazon S3 is one of Amazon's Storage Services (AWS has several). What do I mean by storage? It is a place where you can put files in, like your local machine Hard-Drive-Disk (but it is not local anymore - and you pay for it). Have you ever used `Dropbox`? They started by using AWS S3 (I think they migrated by now). Netflix was/is also a customer of AWS S3. Anyway, it is a quite flexible scalable storage. So let's explore a little bit how to create and use AWS S3. \n",

You can also interact with S3 using `boto3`. Check the documentation [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html)."

As an incentive to your memory, I'll be checking any unused resources after the lab deadline. If there are unused resources still active, there will be a 10% penalty in the lab grade.
